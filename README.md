# Employee Management System APIs

# Tech stack : TypeScript | Node.js | Express.js | Swagger UI | Jest 

The Employee Management System APIs is a server-side application that provides a REST API interface for managing employee data. It is built using TypeScript, Node.js, Express.js, Swagger UI, and Jest.

## Tech Stack

- **TypeScript:** A superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing and other features to improve code readability and maintainability.

- **Node.js:** A powerful server-side runtime environment that allows running JavaScript code outside the browser, enabling server-side applications.

- **Express.js:** A flexible and minimalist web framework for Node.js that provides a robust set of features for building web applications and APIs.

- **Swagger UI:** A tool that automatically generates interactive API documentation from a Swagger/OpenAPI specification, making it easier to explore and understand the API endpoints.

- **Jest:** A JavaScript testing framework that focuses on simplicity and provides an intuitive and powerful way to write unit tests for your code.

## Architecture

The Employee Management System APIs follow the model-controller-services (MCS) architecture pattern, which helps separate concerns and improve maintainability. The application architecture consists of the following layers:

1. **Model:** The model layer defines the structure and validation rules for the employee data. It ensures that the data adheres to the predefined structure and prevents unexpected behavior.

2. **Controller:** The controller layer handles HTTP requests and responses, routing incoming requests to the appropriate services. It acts as the interface between the clients and the underlying business logic.

3. **Services:** The services layer contains the main logic of the application. It handles data access and manipulation, performs business logic operations, and communicates with the model layer to validate and process the data.

## Features

The Employee Management System APIs provide the following features:

- **CRUD Operations:** Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing employee data.

- **Schema Validation:** The application enforces schema validation both on the request and database side to ensure proper object operations. This guarantees that the data adheres to the predefined structure and rules.

- **Authorization Middleware:** The application implements middleware to validate employee supervisor authorization before processing sensitive operations. This adds an extra layer of security by ensuring that only authorized users can perform these operations.
