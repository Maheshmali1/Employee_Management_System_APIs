# Employee Management System APIs

# Tech stack : TypeScript | Node.js | Express.js | Swagger UI | Jest 

- The employee management system is a server-side application that provides a REST API interface for managing employee data. The application is built using Node.js, a powerful server-side runtime environment, and Express.js, a flexible and minimalist web framework for Node.js.

- The application employs a range of modern technologies to ensure robustness, scalability, and maintainability. These include ESLint for code quality and consistency, Jest for testing, Swagger UI for API documentation, and JSON files as the database.

- To ensure type safety and improve code readability, the application is written in TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing, among other features.

- The application follows the model-controller-services (MCS) architecture pattern. The model layer defines the structure and validation of the data. The controller layer handles HTTP requests and responses and communicates with the services layer to perform business logic. The services layer contains the application's main logic and handles data access and manipulation.

- The application enforces schema validation both on the request and database side to ensure proper object operations. This guarantees that the data adheres to the predefined structure and rules and prevents unexpected behavior.

- Additionally, the application implements middleware concepts to validate employee supervisor authorization before processing sensitive operations. This ensures that only authorized users can perform these operations, adding an extra layer of security to the system.

- Overall, the employee management system is a robust and efficient application that provides a seamless employee data management experience through a user-friendly REST API interface.
